# Crime Management – SQL Coding Challenge 3

This project is a SQL-based solution simulating a **Crime Management System** using structured relational data. It includes database design (DDL), sample data population (DML), and real-world analytical SQL queries using SQL Server (tested in Visual Studio 2022).

## Database Overview

The system consists of 3 core tables:

- `crime` – Details of incidents like robbery, homicide, etc.
- `victim` – Victims involved in crimes with contact and age info
- `suspect` – Suspects linked to crimes with profiles and history

## Features Implemented

- Full schema creation using `CREATE TABLE`
- Sample data insertion for testing
- 20 real-world SQL queries to analyze crime data

## Sample Queries Solved

- List of all open incidents
- Count and types of incidents
- Victim and suspect age analysis
- Cases with no suspects
- Suspects involved in multiple crimes
- Incidents where suspects are older than victims
- Crimes involving common names (e.g., 'Doe')
- Incidents combining multiple crime types like 'Robbery' and 'Homicide'

## Tech Used

- SQL Server (Visual Studio 2022)
- Standard ANSI SQL
- Joins, Aggregates, Grouping, Subqueries, Conditional Filters

## How to Use

- Run the provided SQL script to:
  - Create the database and tables
  - Insert mock data
  - Execute all queries in a testable, readable format
